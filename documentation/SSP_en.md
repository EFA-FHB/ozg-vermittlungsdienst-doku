# The self-service portal of the Public Purchasing Data Service

The self-service portal of the Public Purchasing Data Service for the production environment is available at the URL https://self-service.datenservice-oeffentlicher-einkauf.de/.
There is also the portal for the staging environment https://self-service.staging.datenservice-oeffentlicher-einkauf.de/ and the portal for the preview environment https://self-service.preview.datenservice-oeffentlicher-einkauf.de/.
<br><br>
As an operating and support platform, the self-service portal offers user-friendly access to all [documents](https://self-service.datenservice-oeffentlicher-einkauf.de/documentation) of the Public Purchasing Data Service.

## Roles in the self-service portal

To log in to the portal, a user must be created by clicking on 'Register' to create a new account. If an account for the self-service portal already exists, this can be used. This user can now be verified via a new process. A PDF with a declaration of commitment can also be uploaded in the verification process. However, there is no fixed template for this. This document confirms that the person named there is authorized to manage accounts for their company as a specialist procedure manufacturer.

> **WARNING** <br>
> Please use the e-mail address of a mailbox for the Self-Service Portal admin account, but not a personal one, so that other people from the organization can also manage the Vermittlungsdienst accounts and dashboard accounts. The admin account of the self-service portal is protected by two-factor authentication via e-mail, which is why access to the mailbox is absolutely necessary for authorized persons.

After verification of the Self-Service Portal admin account, this account can be used to create so-called Dashboard users and Vermittlungsdienst users with their own e-mail and password. For each dashboard user, you can explicitly select from which submitting systems (Vermittlungsdienst accounts) this user should be able to view the notices.

> **TIP** <br>
> Only dashboard users can see the announcement table, NOT the admin user of the self-service portal or Vermittlungsdienst users. A dashboard user with a separate e-mail address must therefore also be set up for a self-service portal administrator if they want to see the announcement overview themselves.

### Role overview

> **IMPORTANT** <br>
> All accounts need a unique e-mail address. It is recommended NOT to use personal e-mail addresses for the admin account of the self-service portal!

## User information
### Create account
To create an account in the self-service portal, simply click on the user icon in the top right-hand corner and then select "Register". You then have the option of creating an account with an e-mail address and password. A confirmation e-mail will be sent shortly afterwards to the e-mail address entered. You can confirm the creation of the account via the link contained therein. It is then possible to log in with the access data and access the registration form for verification as an admin of the self-service portal. The form is sent to Support for verification.

### Create a new technical Vermittlungsdienst account
Once an admin account has been created in the Self-Service Portal and verified by Support (see above) and the user is logged in, they can fill out the form to create a technical Vermittlungsdienst account. This is done on the start page in the menu at the top left under "VD account registration". An e-mail with the account details will then be sent to the e-mail address entered.

### Create a new dashboard user
It is also possible to create new dashboard users. To do this, the admin user of the self-service portal must navigate to "Dashboard user registration" and complete the form. One or more Vermittlungsdienst accounts can be selected under "Linked VD account". An email is then sent to the email address entered with the account details and the dashboard user can log in and view all notifications sent from the linked account and their current status.

### View sent notifications (notice table)
With a dashboard user account (see above), you can log in to the portal and view all notifications sent by the linked account(s) as well as their current status and (if available) error messages. The dashboard user can also download the XML file from the table of submitted notices and stop notices in the notice table, provided they have the necessary rights to do so.
