# Self-service portal of the DöE

The self-service portal of the Public Purchasing Data Service for the production environment is available at the URL https://portal.ozg-vermittlungsdienst.de/.
There is also the portal for the staging environment https://portal.staging-ozg-vermittlungsdienst.de/ and the portal for the preview environment https://portal.preview-ozg-vermittlungsdienst.de/.
<br><br>
The Self-Service Portal (SSP) offers user-friendly access to all [documents](https://portal.ozg-vermittlungsdienst.de/documentation) of the Public Procurement Data Service (DöE).

The portal will be an operational and support platform for users. It will help you with the transition and allow you to get away from emails. It will offer more possibilities to manage users and access yourself.

## From 11.12.23: Roles in SSP
### Important information about the release on 11.12.
On 11.12. there will be a new release of the SSP. From this date, your technical VD account will no longer work for logging into the SSP, but will only be used for technical authentication of the system. You must create a user in the portal. To do this, simply click on "Register" in the portal and create a new account. If you already have an SSP Portal account, you can use it. From 11.12. you can then verify this user via a new process. In the verification process, you can then also upload a PDF with a declaration of commitment. However, there is no fixed template for this. The document only serves to assure us that you are authorized to manage accounts for your company as a specialist procedure manufacturer. Please send us a list of all your technical VD accounts (existing accounts of submitting systems) that are to be managed by this new SSP Admin account as soon as possible after creating your account. The list should contain the respective VD account email and the associated platform URL and be sent to so that we can link your account to the VD system accounts accordingly. After verifying your SSP Admin account, you can use this account to create so-called dashboard accounts with your own email and password, as also explained in the FVH meeting. For each dashboard user, you can explicitly select the submitting systems (VD accounts) from which this user should be able to view the announcements. IMPORTANT: Only dashboard users can see the announcement table, NOT SSP admin users or VD accounts. You may therefore have to set up an additional dashboard user as an SSP Admin if you want to see the announcement overview yourself.

## Available services
### From October 2023:
The portal offers the following main functions:
* View documentation
  * There are long-term plans to transfer the documentation that is currently in Github to the portal. The SSP will then later become the central communication channel for the DöE*
* Own creation of admin accounts in SSP for specialist procedure manufacturers (SSP admin accounts)
* Apply for VD user with SSP admin account (replaces account creation by e-mail)
* View overview of announcements
<br>

### Future planned features (implementation 2023):
* SSP admin account can perform user management and rights assignment (e.g. create users who can view announcements)
* Extended management of technical VD accounts (e.g. reset password for connected systems)

## User information
### Create account
To create an account in SSP, please click on the user icon in the top right-hand corner and select "Register". You then have the option of creating an account with an e-mail address and password. A confirmation e-mail will be sent shortly to the e-mail address you entered. Please confirm your account using the link provided. You can then log in with your access data and have access to the registration form for a brokerage service connection.

### Apply for a new technical VD account
Once an admin account has been created in SSP (see above) and the user is logged in, they can fill out the form to apply for a technical VD account. You will find this option in the menu at the top left under "Registration". The form will be sent to Support for checking and, if necessary, approval. After successful approval, an email will be sent to the email address entered with the account details.

### View sent notices (notice table)
Once you have a confirmed VD account for sending notices to the DöE, you can log in to the portal using the access data*. If you then click on "Notices" in the menu at the top left, you will have access to a table with all notices sent from this account and their current status.

**Please note: These are the technical details and logging in to the SSP with them serves as a temporary solution and is not planned for the long term. At a later stage, separate access data will be used for the overview table and this technical data should only be used for sending announcements*.

## Future planned features
In the future, these user processes will be designed differently. The account structure will allow the SSP admin user of the specialist procedure manufacturer more rights and administrative functions.

First, the SSP admin user must be verified. The user fills out a form in which he proves that he is responsible for the specialist procedure manufacturer. This verification is still carried out manually by the support team.

After successful verification, the SSP admin user can create VD accounts without further verification and adapt their own account structure accordingly.

In addition, there will be separate dashboard users, independent of the technical VD accounts. These users will be created by the SSP admin and linked to a technical VD account, giving them access to an overview of the announcements from their assigned VD account in the portal.
