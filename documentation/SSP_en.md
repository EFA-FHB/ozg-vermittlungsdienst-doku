# Self-Service Portal of the DöE

The Self-Serivce Portal of the Data Service Public Purchasing is available at the URL https://portal.ozg-vermittlungsdienst.de/.
<br><br>
The Self-Service Portal (SSP) provides user-friendly access to all [records](https://portal.ozg-vermittlungsdienst.de/documentation) of the Data Service Public Purchasing (DöE).

The portal will be an operations and support platform for users. It will help with transition and allow you to get away from emails. In the future it will offer more possibilities to manage users and access by yourself.

## Available services
### As of October 2023:
The portal will offer the following main features:
* View documentation.
  * *In the long term, it is planned to transfer the documentation that is currently in Github to the portal. The SSP will then later become central communication channel for the DöE*.
* Own creation of admin account in SSP for specialist procedure producers (SSP admin accounts).
* Apply for VD user with SSP admin account (replaces account creation via e-mail)
* View overview of announcements
<br>

### Future planned features (2023 implementation):
* SSP admin account can perform user management and rights assignment (e.g., create users who can view announcements).
* Enhanced management of technical VD accounts (e.g., reset password for connected systems).

## User information
### Create account
To create an account in SSP, please click on the user icon in the upper right corner and select "Register". You will then have the option to create an account with an email address and password. A confirmation email will be sent shortly to the email address entered. Please confirm your account with the included link. After that you can log in with your access data and have access to the registration form for a mediation service connection.

### Apply for a new technical VD account
After an admin account has been created in SSP (see above) and the user is logged in, they can fill out the form to request a technical VD account. The option to do so can be found in the top left menu under "Registration". The form will be sent to support for review and approval if necessary. After successful approval, an email will be sent to the entered email address with the account details.

### View sent notices (Notice table).
Once you have a confirmed VD account to send notices to the DöE, you can log into the portal using the credentials*. If you then click on "Notices" in the top left menu, you will have access to a table with all notices sent from this account as well as their current status. Please note that the overview will not be available until the DOE Go-Live in week 43. However, until then you can already test this feature in the preview and staging environments.

**Please note: This is the technical data and logging in to the SSP with it serves as an interim solution and is not planned for the long term. At a later date, separate credentials will be used for the summary table, and this technical data should be used exclusively for sending announcements.*

## Future planned features
In the future, these user processes will be structured differently. The account structure will allow more rights and administrative functions to the SSP admin user of the subject process vendor.

First, the SSP admin user must be verified. The user fills out a form proving that they are responsible for the specialized procedure manufacturer. This verification is still done manually by support.

After successful verification, the SSP Admin user can create VD and Dashboard accounts without further verification and customize their own account structure to do so.

Additionally, there will be separate dashboard users, independent of the technical VD accounts. These users will be linked to a technical VD account by the SSP Admin and will thus have access to an overview of announcements from their assigned VD account in the portal.
