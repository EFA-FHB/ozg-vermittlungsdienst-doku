# OpenData interface
### General

<details>
<summary>
Is the data contained in the Publication Service freely available via the OpenData interface?
</summary>
Yes, the data contained in the announcement service is freely available. It can be accessed via the OpenData interface of the Public Procurement Data Service (DÖE) - either via a REST API or via a PEPPOL query. Both access methods enable open, standardized retrieval of the published announcement data without access restrictions.

<summary>
How up-to-date is the data that can be accessed via the OpenData interface?
</summary>
 The previous day's data is currently available via the REST API of the OpenData interface. In contrast, the announcements published on the current day can also be made available via a PEPPOL query. This means that the information is usually **more up-to-date** via PEPPOL than via the REST API.
